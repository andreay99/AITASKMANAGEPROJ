# Task Scheduler Project

A Java-based Task Scheduler that manages tasks with priorities and dependencies, tracks task completion, and displays total time estimates for all pending tasks.

## Features
- **Add tasks with custom priorities**: Assign each task a priority level to determine urgency.
- **Define dependencies**: Set dependencies between tasks so one task can only be completed after others.
- **Mark tasks as complete**: Track which tasks are finished and get a summary of pending tasks.
- **Display total estimated time**: Calculate and display the total estimated time for all pending tasks.
- **Motivational message**: A celebration message appears when all tasks are complete!
